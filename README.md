# Expert-SystemTo-Identify-Network-Attacks

Modern businesses that rely on the internet for communication regularly send
confidential information between networks. Moreover, remote accessibility
provides shady parties access to targets that are open to data eavesdropping. They
may violate users' privacy settings and endanger devices with internet connections.
A network attack may take many different forms and dimensions. To protect their
assets from increasingly complex cyber threats, businesses must uphold the highest
standards of network security policy, personnel training, and cybersecurity
requirements.By identifying the many types of network attacks and potential
preventions, this study provides a solution to the aforementioned issue.
This project includes an intuitive user interface that accepts input data from a user
in a restricted English format, matches keywords, and then outputs a restricted
English format response. The user will feed the system's questionable behavior.
The expert system will first use Backward Chaining to determine the type of
attack, and then it will use Forward Chaining to suggest a prevention
